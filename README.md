This repository contains the source code from the article "Including visual criteria into predictive simulation of acrobatics to enhance the realism of optimal techniques".
The code allowed to generate the optimal techniques ([MultiStart.py](MultiStart.py)) and to compare them with an elite athlete's technique ([compile_coaches_judges_ratings.py](compile_coaches_judges_ratings.py)).
